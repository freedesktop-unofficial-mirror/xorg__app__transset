This is a patched version of xorg's transset
I wanted to integrate transset into my windowmanager and to
be able to set and unset transparency by just pressing a key.
To make that possible I didn't want transset to wait for me to
click on a window but instead setting transparency immidietly on
the window under the cursor.

In the future I guess it's ment for the windowmanagers to handle
transparency. Then we will hopefully see this function and many other
now imposible functions (like opacity following the mousepointer).
But this will require you to wait untill this is implementet in
your favorite wm. This patch is my way of "scratching where it itches",
with only minor changes transset can now be used with any windowmanager
to make it do somethink actually usefull.

Features
	-select window by clicking (as transset)
	-select window by pointing
	-force toggle


Any questions/sugestions just send me a email
